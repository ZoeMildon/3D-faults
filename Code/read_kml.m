function [lat,lon,z] = read_kml(fileName)
%READ_KML reads a Google Earth kml file into Matlab
% Reads in lat,lon,z from a simple path file.
%
%  All the data in the data file must EITHER be on one line, for example:
%   -73.6513,40.4551,0 -73.3905,40.5214,0 -73.0589,40.5956,0
% OR each point must be on its own line, for example:
%   -73.237171, 40.627311, 0.0 
%   -73.242945, 40.626360, 0.0 
%
%  I have tried to make this code as robust as possible, but it may still
%  crash if there is a space in the wrong place in the data file.
%
% Example:
%   [lat,lon,z] = read_kml('test.kml');
%
% where test.kml looks like:
% <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
% <kml xmlns="http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1">
