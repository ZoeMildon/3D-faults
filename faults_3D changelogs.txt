Version 1.1
Original version written by Zoe Mildon

Version 1.2
- replaced input by kml- and txt-files by shapefile import
- added user interface (ui.m) to check fault properties, select faults and choose appropriate grid extends before plotting the fault network
- several changes in the 'model_3d_variable_faults.m' script (simplified code, adjusted code for new input format, some restructuring)
- deleted some lines in the main 'faults_3D' file which became useless due to the shp-import and user interface
- deleted readkml.m, wgs2utm.m and the 'Fault_traces' and 'Data' folders

Version 1.3
- added a new import function for kml files:
	- fault properties are now read from a single table (txt, csv, xlsx,...)
	- fault traces are imported from kml file using kml2struct_multi.m (added to Code folder)
	- added the 'Fault_traces' folder and wgs2utm.m back to the project
- changed names of input fields to 'fault_name','dip','rake','dip_dir','len'; input fields must have exactly these names in table or shp import
- added 'input_examples' folder with various different input files

Version 1.4 - in preparation
- added import from .kmz-file (+ .txt-file)
- added import selection dialog (shp, kml or kmz) and import via uigetfile
- added code that checks the names of input attributes (e.g. fault_name, dip,..). If names vary from the default names they can be entered during execution.
- faults with missing values are now automatically deselected in user interface table and missing fields are highlighted
- improved error and warning dialogs (more detailed information,...)
- faults longer than the seismogenic depth are now cut at the seismogenic depth, so that no fault reaches deeper
- restructured 'model_3D_variable_faults.m':
	- check for missing data and wrong data types is now at the beginning of the script
	- all error dialogs appear before the UI closes, so the user can change the input table and execute again
