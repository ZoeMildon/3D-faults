Version 1.1
Original version written by Zoe Mildon

Version 1.2
- replaced input by kml- and txt-files by shapefile import
- added user interface (ui.m) to check fault properties, select faults and choose appropriate grid extends before plotting the fault network
- several changes in the 'model_3d_variable_faults.m' script (simplified code, adjusted code for new input format, some restructuring)
- deleted some lines in the main 'faults_3D' file which became useless due to the shp-import and user interface
- deleted readkml.m, wgs2utm.m and the 'Fault_traces' and 'Data' folders

Version 1.3
- added a new import function for kml files:
	- fault properties are now read from a single table (txt, csv, xlsx,...)
	- fault traces are imported from kml file using kml2struct_multi.m (added to Code folder)
	- added the 'Fault_traces' folder and wgs2utm.m back to the project
- changed names of input fields to 'fault_name','dip','rake','dip_dir','len'; input fields must have exactly these names in table or shp import
- added 'input_examples' folder with various different input files

Version 1.4
- added import from .kmz-file (+ table)
- added import selection dialog (shp, kml or kmz) and import via uigetfile
- added code that checks the names of input attributes (e.g. fault_name, dip,..). If names vary from the default names they can be entered during execution.
  --> input fields no longer need to have the exact same names!
- added button to calculate fault length from input data
- added depth column to UI table to specify the depth of single faults (useful to avoid cross-cutting faults)
- added export button: export changes to the input data to a .csv-file
- faults with missing values are now automatically deselected in user interface table and missing fields are highlighted
- improved error and warning dialogs (more detailed information,...)
- faults longer than the seismogenic depth are now cut at the seismogenic depth, so that no fault reaches deeper
- restructured 'model_3D_variable_faults.m':
	- check for missing data and wrong data types is now at the beginning of the script
	- all error dialogs appear before the 3D-plot executes, so the user can change the input table and execute again
	- the UI does not close anymore, so the 3D-plot can be repeated multiple times with changed parameters

Version 1.5
- restructured the user interface:
	- the UI is now built up by 3 separate tabs
	- the ui.m script was replaced by the uitab1.m and uitab2.m script
	- variables are now stored externally and can be changed in the UI (added config.txt to Code)
	- deleted almost all content of the faults_3D.m script
- added help buttons at the 'Settings' interface tab (added uihelp.m to Code)
- made map margin size changeable in ui tab2

Version 1.6
- added variable dip faults (import of variable dip information via button in uitab2)
- added custom configuration of the settings (grid size etc.)
- settings in both uitabs can now be changed and the plot can be updated without needing to restart the code
- several bug-fixes

Version 1.7 (changes made by Zoe Mildon)
- removed "Coulomb Grid Size" from input GUI and set it to 10, as it is not integral to building the fault, potential for confusion, and it's very easy to change in Coulomb
- Minor text changes for the GUI and changed the colours of buttons
- attempted to re-write how the slip distribution is calculated - needs testing after the GUI has been rearranged

Version 1.7b (changes made by Manuel)
- rearranged GUI and related code:
	- GUI is built up in ui.m script, faults  are imported and input data configured in the fault_import.m script (replaced uitab1.m and uitab2.m)
	- settings, fault preview etc. shifted to the 2nd ui tab (now called customisation)
- multiple bugs fixed which occurred after the recent changes of version 1.7 and 1.7b and extensive testing

Version 1.7c
- rewritten code to calculate the slip-distribution for a partial fault rupture
- minor changes to GUI

Version 1.8
- added 'Open in new Window'-button to the plot tab (makes figure export easier)
- added button to select UTM zone on map
- several minor fixes, UI changes, changes to the uihelp.m

Version 1.8b
- source fault is now plotted first and always appears on top of the .inr output
- magnitude is displayed in plot tab in UI
- some changes to help box texts

Version 1.9
- removed 'calculate length' button
- length is now always calculated from input coordinates, 'len' column in input files is no longer used
- depth may now be (optionally) specified in input files
- changed the use of the depth for down-dip length claculation:
	- if depth is given, it is used to calculated down-dip length of the fault from the dp angle
	- if depth is not given, the seismogenic depth is used instead
	- if the fault is shorter than the seismogenic depth, a 'real' (down dip) aspect ratio of 1 is applied
- minor changes in the UI, some variables and code comments

Version 2.0
- basically the same as v. 1.9 with minor changes to the UI and few bugs fixed
- version released on github.com/ZoeMildon/3D-faults main

Version 2.1
- added buttons to select/deselect all faults to be plotted
- added dropdown menu to sort the fault table by name, depth or length
- added option to automatically detect faults that intersect other faults and cut them at the matching depth
	--> faults are plotted in the order they occur in the table, source fault is always first; at intersections faults that are plotted later will be cut
- added back the option to plot faults in an external figure instead of the user interface (better performance)
- bug fixes:
	- calculation of fault down dip length for short faults
	- automatic calculation of vertical centre for short source faults

Version 2.2
- improvements of the function to cut intersecting faults:
	- added option to define major and minor faults by setting a priority in the uitable
	- priority values can now be imported from the input files (table or shapefile attributes)
	- plotting of source fault as the first fault is now optional, as it may interfere with the intersecting faults functionality
	- restructured UI to add new interface elements
	- refining the intersection grid to erase artifacts. Enables the distance threshold to be smaller (~0.5*grid size advised)
	- added option (incl. button) to plot only the source fault (saves time)
	- added help texts
	- fixed the plot of intersecting faults (plotted patches were not identical with exported patches)
	- fixed bugs causing erroneous seismic moment and slip distribution calculation for intersecting faults
- fixed important bug in the variable dip import
- fixed an issue with slip distribution calculation for faults with variable dip
- fixed the style for uitable (highlighting faults with missing data or variable dip)
- various other bug fixes
